# Writing User Stories

## Format

Use this simple template:

```
As a [user type]
I want to [action]
So that [benefit]
```

## Examples

### Good User Story
```
As a student
I want to submit assignments with file attachments
So that I can turn in homework without email delays
```

### Avoid Being Too Vague
❌ "Build assignment system"
✅ "As a student, I want to upload a PDF file to an assignment, so I can submit homework digitally"

## Acceptance Criteria

Add clear requirements:

```
User Story: As a student, I want to track my assignment deadline

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Deadline is displayed on assignment card
- [ ] Overdue assignments show red warning
- [ ] Dashboard shows days remaining for each assignment
- [ ] Deadline reminder sent 24 hours before
```

## Tips

- **Keep it small**: One story = 1-2 days of work max
- **User-focused**: Start with "as a..." not technical details
- **Testable**: You should be able to verify it's done
- **Independent**: Don't make stories depend on each other
