# Managing the Product Backlog

## What is the Product Backlog?

A prioritized list of everything the project needs (features, bugs, improvements). It's constantly updated as you learn more.

## Structure

Priority | Item | Effort | Status
---------|------|--------|-------
1 | User login system | M | Not Started
2 | Submit assignments | L | Not Started
3 | Grade tracking | M | Not Started
4 | Email notifications | S | Not Started
...


## How to Prioritize

Use these questions (in order):
1. **Does it block other work?** (Move to top)
2. **Is it critical to MVP?** (Higher priority)
3. **Do users need it now?** (Higher priority)
4. **Is it a quick win?** (Lower priority, do later)

## Backlog Refinement

Do this once per sprint (30 mins):
- Add new items from team or stakeholders
- Remove items that are no longer needed
- Break down large items into smaller stories
- Reorder based on changing priorities

## Tips

- **Start lean**: Only plan 2-3 sprints ahead
- **Keep it alive**: Update constantly, not just at sprint planning
- **Be honest**: Mark items "nice-to-have" vs "must-have"
- **Learn as you go**: Backlog changes as you understand the project better
