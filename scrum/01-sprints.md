# Sprint Workflow for Student Teams

## What is a Sprint?

A sprint is a fixed time period (typically 1-2 weeks) where your team completes a set amount of work. For student projects, we recommend **1-week sprints** to maintain momentum and stay flexible.

## Sprint Structure

### Sprint Planning (Start of Sprint)
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes
- **What to do**: 
  - Review product backlog (prioritized list of features/fixes)
  - Select items to complete this sprint
  - Break down items into smaller tasks
  - Estimate effort (use t-shirt sizes: XS, S, M, L, XL)
  - Assign tasks to team members

### Daily Standup (Each Day)
- **Duration**: 10-15 minutes
- **Questions each member answers**:
  1. What did I complete yesterday?
  2. What am I working on today?
  3. What blockers do I have?
- **How**: Quick call or Slack message in thread

### Sprint Review (End of Sprint)
- **Duration**: 30 minutes
- **What to do**: Demo completed work to team
- **Focus**: What's working, not just code

### Sprint Retrospective (End of Sprint)
- **Duration**: 20-30 minutes
- **What to discuss**:
  - What went well?
  - What could improve?
  - Action items for next sprint

## Tips for Student Teams

- **Start small**: 1-week sprints help you learn faster
- **Be realistic**: Don't overload sprints; better to finish with confidence
- **Keep communication**: Daily standups prevent surprises
- **Adjust as you go**: Retros should drive real changes in how you work
