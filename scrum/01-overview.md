# Scrum: Framework for Team Success

## START HERE: What is Scrum?

Scrum is a lightweight framework to organize team work. It helps you:
- Plan work clearly
- Track progress
- Communicate effectively
- Adapt when things change

**Key idea**: Work in short cycles (sprints) with regular check-ins.

**About these guides:**
This guide (01-overview) explains the framework. Other guides dive into details:
- **02-daily-standup-and-reviews.md** - Daily standups, sprint reviews, retrospectives
- **03-user-stories.md** - Writing user stories and acceptance criteria
- **04-product-backlog.md** - Managing and prioritizing your backlog
- **05-team-communication.md** - Team dynamics and communication

## Scrum Roles

### Product Owner (Usually Instructor or Tech Lead)
- Defines what features to build
- Prioritizes work
- Accepts completed work
- Removes blockers

### Scrum Master (Team Coordinator)
- Facilitates meetings
- Removes roadblocks
- Coaches the team
- Tracks velocity

### Development Team (You)
- Estimates effort
- Does the work
- Communicates daily
- Helps each other succeed

**Note**: In academic settings, one person can have multiple roles.

## Sprint Cycle (Usually 1-2 Weeks)

```
Day 1: Planning    → Define work
Day 2-4: Work      → Build features
Day 5: Review      → Show what's done
Day 5: Retro       → Improve process
                     ↓ Start next sprint
```

For CommitEd: We use **1-week sprints** to maintain momentum and stay flexible.

## Key Ceremonies (Meetings)

### Sprint Planning
**When**: Start of sprint (e.g., Monday morning)  
**Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**Output**: Sprint backlog (what you'll do this sprint)

See **02-daily-standup-and-reviews.md** for details.

### Daily Standup
**When**: Every morning (10 minutes)  
**Who**: Whole team  
**Format**: Each person answers 3 questions (see guide 02)

### Sprint Review  
**When**: End of sprint (e.g., Friday afternoon)  
**Duration**: 1 hour  
**What**: Demonstrate completed work to team + Product Owner

See **02-daily-standup-and-reviews.md** for details.

### Sprint Retrospective
**When**: After sprint review (same day)  
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes  
**Who**: Just the team (no Product Owner usually)  
**Purpose**: What went well? What didn't? What to improve?

See **02-daily-standup-and-reviews.md** for details.

## Sprint Length Decision

### 1-Week Sprint
- ✅ Fast feedback
- ✅ Good for learning
- ❌ More meetings
- Best for: Academic projects, learning teams

### 2-Week Sprint
- ✅ More focus time
- ✅ Deeper features
- ❌ Less flexibility
- Best for: Mature teams, long-term projects

### Recommendation for CommitEd
Start with **1 week**. You can adjust after Sprint 1.

## Core Concepts

### User Stories
"As a [user type], I want to [action], so that [benefit]"

See **03-user-stories.md** for detailed guide.

### Story Points (Estimation)
Estimate effort, not time:
- 1 = trivial (30 min)
- 3 = small (1-2 hours)
- 5 = medium (half day)
- 8 = large (1-2 days)
- 13 = very large (3+ days, should split)

### Product Backlog
Prioritized list of all features/fixes to build

See **04-product-backlog.md** for detailed guide.

### Sprint Backlog
What you committed to build THIS sprint

### Velocity
How many story points your team completes per sprint

Helps predict future sprints:
- Sprint 1: 22 points
- Sprint 2: 25 points
- Sprint 3: 20 points
- Average: ~23 points

## How It All Fits Together

```
                    PRODUCT BACKLOG
                    (All future work)
                           ↓
         Sprint Planning (Team commits to work)
                           ↓
         SPRINT BACKLOG (This sprint's work)
                           ↓
         Daily Standup (Keep team synced)
                           ↓
         Work (Build, test, review)
                           ↓
         Sprint Review (Show what you built)
                           ↓
         Sprint Retrospective (Improve next sprint)
                           ↓
         Repeat (Next sprint starts)
```

## Why Scrum Works

### 1. Regular Feedback
- Daily standups catch blockers early
- Sprint reviews show progress
- Retros improve your process

### 2. Predictability
- Velocity helps forecast when you'll finish
- Sprint goal keeps focus
- Clear acceptance criteria

### 3. Adaptability
- 1-week cycle = easy to adjust
- Backlog can be reprioritized
- Retrospectives drive real changes

### 4. Team Health
- Everyone knows what's happening
- Blockers surface immediately
- Celebrates progress together

## For CommitEd Teams

CommitEd Scrum pattern:

1. **Sprint Planning** (Monday morning, 1 hour)
   - Select user stories from backlog
   - Break into tasks
   - Estimate story points
   - Assign to team members

2. **Daily Standup** (Morning, 10 min)
   - 3 questions each
   - GitHub Projects board updated
   - Blockers surfaced

3. **Work** (Tue-Thu)
   - Create feature branches
   - Regular commits
   - PRs to dev branch
   - Code reviews

4. **Sprint Review** (Friday afternoon, 1 hour)
   - Demo completed work
   - Product Owner accepts
   - Celebrate wins

5. **Sprint Retrospective** (Friday afternoon, 30-45 min)
   - What went well?
   - What didn't?
   - Action items for next sprint

6. **Next Sprint**
   - Start again Monday

## Common Issues & How Scrum Prevents Them

| Problem | Scrum Solution |
|---------|----------------|
| Team doesn't know what to work on | Product Backlog (prioritized) |
| Work goes off track | Daily standup catches issues early |
| Unknown blockers | Standup surfaces problems |
| Scope keeps growing | Sprint backlog protects focus |
| Poor estimation | Velocity helps future planning |
| Low morale | Celebrate every sprint review |
| Can't improve | Retrospective drives changes |
| Communication issues | Multiple sync points daily |

## Tips for Success

✅ **Be realistic** - Estimate based on complexity, not hope

✅ **Communicate** - Daily standup is non-negotiable

✅ **Adapt** - If something's not working, change it

✅ **Document** - Sprint goals, demos, retro notes matter

✅ **Celebrate** - You're working as a team!

## Your Next Steps
